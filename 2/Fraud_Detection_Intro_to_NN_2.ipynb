This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.\n","\n","It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data is not provided. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\n","\n","Source: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"O42XXcQtFuXx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334444048,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}}},"source":["%tensorflow_version 2.x"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2Ro7A1N5y6Hh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334448360,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4320,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn import preprocessing\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, precision_recall_curve, auc\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from tensorflow.keras import optimizers\n"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"spJIiLsDeP2K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334448361,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}}},"source":["from google.colab import drive"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BikwTj1_eSKh","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334486530,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":38179,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}},"outputId":"e1dc715a-5621-42ac-e50e-5e29d652a377"},"source":["drive.mount('/content/drive/')"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive/\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Q-cL3gdjeSM3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334486531,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}}},"source":["project_path = ''"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8wIx9ivZeSPP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334486531,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}}},"source":["dataset_file = project_path + 'creditcard.csv'"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OM0t4RaJe10y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334490413,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3894,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}}},"source":["data = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/AIML Program/Practice/Neural Network /week 2/creditcard.csv\")"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LzmnvBMKe13i","outputId":"5280cce3-d55e-49df-b8ba-b13a7557d977","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":299},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649334490415,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Ashish Tiwari","userId":"08890013030836632194"}}},"source":["data.head()"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Time        V1        V2        V3        V4        V5        V6        V7  \\\n","0   0.0 -1.359807 -0.072781  2.536347  1.378155 -0.338321  0.462388  0.239599   \n","1   0.0  1.191857  0.266151  0.166480  0.448154  0.060018 -0.082361 -0.078803   \n","2   1.0 -1.358354 -1.340163  1.773209  0.379780 -0.503198  1.800499  0.791461   \n","3   1.0 -0.966272 -0.185226  1.792993 -0.863291 -0.010309  1.247203  0.237609   \n","4   2.0 -1.158233  0.877737  1.548718  0.403034 -0.407193  0.095921  0.592941   \n","\n","         V8        V9  ...
